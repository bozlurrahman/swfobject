For the past months I have been browsing the web with Safari on the iPhone and it made me realize how many web authors still use outdated methods to embed plugin content. Unfortunately iPhone doesnâ€™t support Adobe Flash content and many other plugins, and the result is millions of Lego-like blocks - like the good old Netscape puzzle piece - to indicate missing plugin content:

What a pollution.

The solution is rather simple: avoid the use of the HTML embed element and don't use any [twice-cooked markup](http://alistapart.com/articles/flashembedcagematch) (that means that you should ignore the [large heap](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/embed2.html) of [outdated vendor documentation](http://www.adobe.com/go/tn_4150) out there), because this doesn't enable you to use fallback content. Use an HTML object element based approach instead: use SWFObject 2 to embed Adobe Flash content and for other types of plugin content it is best to use the [nested objects method](http://alistapart.com/articles/byebyeembed), which enables the use of alternative content, which is a best practice. Just make the web a better place.

Because Flash and QuickTime (which is supported by the iPhone) both support MP4 video, you could even use this approach to offer video content in a cascaded manner. Just make sure to encode your video with the right encoding settings: [1](http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/CreatingVideoforSafarioniPhone/chapter_9_section_4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006514-SW9) and [2](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/hd_video_flash_player.html).

You can view a demo of this concept [here](http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/playground/swfobject/iphone/index.html):

The markup (videoplayer.fla is included in the [demo's directory](http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/playground/swfobject/iphone/videoplayer.fla)):
```
<object id="videoContent" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="320" height="240">
  <param name="movie" value="videoplayer.swf" />
  <param name="flashvars" value="movie=mario.mp4" />
<!--[if !IE]>-->
  <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="videoplayer.swf" width="320" height="240">
    <param name="flashvars" value="movie=mario.mp4" />
    <object type="video/mp4" data="mario_click.jpg" width="320" height="256">
      <param name="controller" value="false" />
      <param name="src" value="mario_click.jpg" />
      <param name="href" value="mario.mp4" />
      <param name="target" value="myself" />
<!--<![endif]-->
        <img src="mario.jpg" alt="" />
<!--[if !IE]>-->
      </object>
    </object>
<!--<![endif]-->
</object>
```

I used SWFObject 2 static publishing with alternative content (a JPG) and nested an additional object element to target any plugin that has registered itself with media type video/mp4. Et voila, we have video content on the desktop and on the iPhone while using only one media file.

The video was taken on the [Flash on the Beach](http://www.flashonthebeach.com) 2007 conference in Brighton, UK, and shows a snippet of [Mario Klingemann](http://www.quasimondo.com)'s brilliant and incredibly funny presentation.

Note:
If you use QuickTime to export a mov as an mpeg4 file:
  * click options
  * under the video tab make sure that H.264 is your fomat
  * press video options on the same page
  * make sure that Baseline profile is ticked only
  * press ok
  * press ok
  * press save

And you should have one mp4 file that works both in Flash and on the iPhone.
