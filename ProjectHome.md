## Getting started ##

Welcome! You'll probably want to start with:
  * [SWFObject documentation](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation)
  * [Detecting Flash Player versions and embedding SWF files with SWFObject 2](http://www.adobe.com/cn/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swfobject.html) (beginners level tutorial)
  * [Providing alternative content for SWF files](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/alternative_content.html) (beginners level tutorial)

Please **DO NOT** link directly to the JavaScript files in our SVN repository. Either download swfobject\_2\_x.zip from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/downloads/list) section and place a copy of the SWFObject 2 script on your own web server or link to a hosted version of the script provided by the [Google AJAX Libraries API](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/hosted_library).

## News ##

SWFObject 2.2 is available for download! It's good, go [get it!](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/downloads/list) You can read more about it in [SWFObject 2.2 - What's new?](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/whats_new)

## Questions, bugs ##

If you have any questions or comments about SWFObject or have problems with an implementation, please make sure you have read our [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/faq) and use the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/swfobject).

If you find any bugs or want to request a future enhancement, you can fill in an issue report on the [issues page](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/issues/list).
